Project Overview
Build a web application that analyzes LinkedIn posts to learn user's writing style, generates personalized content, and creates matching visual assets (infographics and images) using AI.


Complete User Flow
Phase 1: User Onboarding
 
1. Landing Page
→ User sees demo/preview of generated content
→ Clear value proposition: "Create LinkedIn posts in your style with matching visuals"
→ Sign up button (email/password)

2. Account Creation
→ Simple registration form
→ Email verification (optional for MVP)
→ Redirect to onboarding

3. Onboarding Process
→ Welcome message: "Let's learn your writing style" ( USe openai api for analyzing style)
→ Upload interface: "Paste 4-5 of your previous LinkedIn posts"
→ Text areas for each post (labeled Post 1, Post 2, etc.)
→ "Analyze My Style" button
→ Loading screen: "AI is learning your writing patterns..."
→ Success message: "Style analysis complete! Ready to create content."
→ Redirect to dashboard
Phase 2: Content Creation Flow
 
4. Dashboard
→ Clean interface with "Create New Post" button
→ History section showing previous generated content
→ User profile/settings in header
→ Credit balance display (for Dodo payments)

5. Post Generation
→ Input field: "What do you want to post about?"
→ Placeholder examples: "5 tips for LinkedIn growth", "My startup journey"
→ Generate button
→ Loading: "Creating your post..."
→ Generated post displayed in editable text area
→ Edit/Regenerate options
→ "Continue to Visuals" button

6. Visual Strategy Decision
→ AI analysis results displayed:
"Your post is about '5 Tips to Go Viral on LinkedIn'"
"AI detected: List format with 5 key points"

→ Recommendation box:
"AI Recommendation: 6 images (1 intro + 5 tip cards)"
"Estimated credits: 6 credits"

→ Format selection (radio buttons):
○ Single Infographic (all content in one image) - 1 credit
○ Carousel Post (6 separate images) - 6 credits ← AI recommended
○ Custom (let me choose number of images)

→ If "Custom" selected:
- Slider/input: "How many images? (1-10)"
- Credit cost updates dynamically

→ Visual style selection:
○ Infographics (data-focused, clean design)
○ Quote Cards (bold text, minimal design)
○ Mixed Style (combination approach)

→ Preview summary: "You'll receive: 6 infographic images for your carousel"
→ "Generate Visuals" button

7. Visual Generation Process
→ Loading screen: "Creating your visuals..." with progress bar
→ Show individual image generation progress:
"✓ Intro image complete"
"⏳ Tip 1 image generating..."
"⏳ Tip 2 image pending..."
→ Allow cancellation during generation
→ Error handling: "Generation failed - try different style"

8. Preview & Download
→ Display all generated visuals in grid/carousel view
→ Individual image options for each visual:
- Download individual image
- Regenerate this image
- Edit prompt for this image
→ Bulk actions:
- Download all as ZIP
- Regenerate entire set
- Share preview link
→ Post text displayed alongside visuals
→ "Create Another Post" button
Phase 3: Dashboard Management
 
9. Content History
→ List of all generated posts with:
- Post title/topic
- Generation date
- Format (single/carousel)
- Number of images
- Actions: Download, Regenerate, Delete

10. Account Management
→ Credit balance and usage history
→ Subscription status (Dodo payments integration)
→ Style profile settings
→ Download history
